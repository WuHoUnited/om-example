#om-example

This project contains some examples of `ClojureScript` and `Om` code.

The examples will focus on building multiple components which will be capable of rendering the same data in different ways.
Some of the components may be editable and when edited you will see how the changes are immediately  and automatically reflected in other components.


#Quick Start

1) Compile the code with `lein cljsbuild once prod`

2) Open the `public/prod/index.html` file in a web-browser
